Get the IP addresses for both computers. In this case, the NUC is at 129.219.195.116 and the Vbox is at 129.219.195.119.
On the NUC run the commands:
export ROS_IP=129.219.195.116
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://129.219.195.119:11311
On the Vbox run the commands:
export ROS_IP=129.219.195.119
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://129.219.195.119:11311

On the Vbox, run the command:
roscore

On the NUC, run the command
roslaunch usb_cam-test.launch

On the Vbox, if you run the command
rostopic list
You should see a bunch of usb_cam and usb_cam1 topics
Run the command
roslaunch usb_cam-receiver-test.launch

And the camera feeds from the NUC should appear on the Vbox screen!
