We will first want to make sure that the default driver for the xbox controller (xpad) is removed.
Run the command "sudo rmmod xpad"
We then want to make sure that this driver will never be loaded automatically again.
Run the command "sudo su"
Run the command "echo "blacklist xpad" > /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf"
Install xboxdrv
Run the command "sudo add-apt-repository ppa:grumbel/ppa"
Run the command "sudo apt-get update"
Run the command "sudo apt-get install xboxdrv"
With the Xbox controller plugged into the computer
Run the command "sudo xboxdrv"
You should now see the screen update with every event change on the controller.
Now install the ROS node Joy
Run the command "sudo apt-get install ros-jade-joy"
To test to make sure things are working, open a new terminal window
Run the command "roscore"
Now open another (this is the third) terminal window
Run the command "rosrun joy joy_node"
Now open a fourth terminal window
Run the command "rostopic echo joy"
In this final window you should see an output of every event change on the controller. This is being broadcast on the ROS network under the topic name "joy"
